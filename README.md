# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

In this project a simple micro service is written to filter images and that microservice is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
